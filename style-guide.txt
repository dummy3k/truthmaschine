>    Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
>    Never mix tabs and spaces.
>    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
>    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
    - Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module
      comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.


>    Code in the core Python distribution should aways use the ASCII or
    Latin-1 encoding (a.k.a. ISO-8859-1).  For Python 3.0 and beyond,
    UTF-8 is preferred over Latin-1, see PEP 3120.

>   The naming conventions of Python's library are a bit of a mess, so we'll
    never get this completely consistent -- nevertheless, here are the
    currently recommended naming standards.
	
      Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by
      underscores as necessary to improve readability.

      Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance
      variables.
